As a regular not logged user,
When I start the application,
And I am on "Conference Details" form,
And I click the "Login" button,
And I am on "Login" form,
And I type a invalid email address in the email text box,
And I type a invalid password in the password text box,
And I press the Login button,
I should see a message box saying that "The credentials are not valid"
