As a regular not logged user,
When I start the application,
And I am on "Conference Details" form,
And I click the "Login" button,
And I am on "Login" form,
And I click the "Reset Password" button,
And I am on "Reset Password" form,
And I type an email on the email text box,
And I click the "ResetPassword" button,
Then I should see a message box saying that the email has been sent successfully
And my password is changed in the database
And I receive a mail with the new password
